Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The Security Group attached to the Recipe Instance has the following Ingress Rules which could easily be exploited. 
* Inbound Rule: TCP on port 80
* Inbound Rule: All traffic in all ports

These rules pose a serious security risk and leaves the machine vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. They should be removed and instead a rule allowing traffic from the load balancer should be added.


# Poor practice 2
The provisioned S3 buckets do not have any permissions or policies to restrict who is allowed to make changes on them. This is especially important for the Secret Recipe bucket.
We could also restrict traffic to the s3 bucket to IP addresses that fall within our VPC only, likely using its CIDR block
