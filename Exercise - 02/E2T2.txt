The following steps could remediate the above issues:
* Remove the rule allowing access to all ports 0 - 65535
* The ports allowing SSH access should be blocked as well since its not being used
* Port 80 could be blocke as well if a SG rule is set on the Application Instance to allow inbound traffic from the Load Balancer SG
